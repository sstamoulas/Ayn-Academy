                  <p>The Name AYN Academy was born out of humor. When trying to come up with a name for our new academy what we began with was slogans and our favorite was &quot;Tomorrow&#39;s better you today&quot;. Sadly, this does not make for a good acronym but we wanted to keep this idea. Brainstorming but clutching to our original idea, we Watered it
                  down a bit (a lot) and we came up with the awkward &quot;amazing you now&quot;. Thus, the acronym AYN.</p>
                  <p>AYN itself is actually a great name for what we seek to accomplish as the word in Arabic has several meanings, each one correlating to our aims. From the meanings is &quot;eye&quot; and &quot;fountain&quot;. The eye is known as the window to the soul and this is part of what we aim to help people do - look within and do real soul searching in order to come to know themselves. We also hope to be a fountain from which beneficial and life enriching services spring forth and flow. From the meanings of this word in Arabic are also the connotations of creating, assisting, supplying and helping to rescue. Knowing this, it wasn&#39;t a difficult decision to stick with it.</p>
                  <p>In choosing our Logo we decided to use the Arabic letter AYN bearing a flame. This was to make the name itself clear as well as symbolize our mission, to serve as a light giving lantern in these dark times.</p>
                  <p>Without a doubt we are people of faith. However, part of the very purpose of this academy is to be able to serve a greater audience of humanity by separating (as much as possible) our wellness modalities from our teaching our faith. In this way, though we may speak from our hearts, we are not seeking to use this platform to proselytize.</p>
                  <p>For this reason, we have developed the AYN Academy and invite you to allow us to share with you the wellness modalities we have been blessed to learn.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Our mission statement is simple: we wish to use and share the skills we have been blessed with in order to help others.</li>
                    <li>Our methods vary on the situations, needs and requests of our clients. Whether interpersonal consultations in person or through online platforms, one on one or in groups we do our best to make ourselves available.</li>
                    <li>What we offer is an array of integrative wellness modalities including Chakra clearing, Reiki, identity coaching, happiness coaching, Relationship/team workshops Goal success coaching, consulting, Addiction help, hypnosis workshops, Art therapy workshops, herbal and aromatherapy consultations and workshops, doula services as well as assistance regarding natural birthing and lactation services.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="mb-0">Along with this, we also teach workshops on 5 element qi-kung and Wholistic Self defense.</p>
